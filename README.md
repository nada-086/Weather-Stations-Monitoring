## Weather Monitoring System

The problem at hand is to design and implement a robust weather monitoring system that efficiently processes data from distributed weather stations. This system should be capable of:

Data Acquisition: Collecting real-time data from multiple weather stations located in different geographical locations.
Data Processing & Archiving: Processing the incoming data streams and storing them in a format suitable for analysis and long-term storage.
Indexing & Querying: Indexing the stored data for efficient retrieval and analysis. This includes maintaining a key-value store for the latest readings from each station and utilizing a search and visualization tool like ElasticSearch and Kibana for more comprehensive analysis.
